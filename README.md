QuickFix-server-client
======================

c++ QuickFIX server and client app 
 1. I had implemented a C++ server to keep feeding the market price message "MarketDataIncrementalRefresh" 
 to all it's connected clients. 
 
 2. I also had implemented a C++ client to connect the server to receive the  "MarketDataIncrementalRefresh" 
 message and record the market prices into the memory, the user then can 
 
 press "1" to write the snapshot to the file, and press "2 to quit the program.
